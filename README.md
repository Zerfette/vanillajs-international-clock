# vanillajs-international-clock

This repository implements a sleek and functional clock using JavaScript and CSS. It allows users to display the time in various time zones, providing a user-friendly experience.

## Features

 - Dynamic clock hands update in real-time, reflecting the current time.

 - Selectable time zones: Users can choose from a comprehensive list of time zones provided by the World Time API.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.

2. Open the index.html file in your web browser to view the clock in action.

## How it Works

The clock leverages JavaScript to:

 - Fetch the user's current time zone using the World Time API (https://worldtimeapi.org/api/ip).
 - Retrieve a list of available time zones (https://worldtimeapi.org/api/timezone).
 - Update the clock hands based on the selected time zone and the current time.
